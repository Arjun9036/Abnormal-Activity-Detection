# Abnormal Activity Detection 🚨🎥

A real-time Abnormal Activity Detection system using Deep Learning and Computer Vision to enhance public safety through automatic recognition of dangerous or suspicious activities such as burglary, assault, drowsiness, and theft from video streams.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages advanced deep learning architectures—CNNs for spatial feature extraction, RNNs (LSTM/GRU) for temporal pattern recognition, and Vision Transformers for high-level feature understanding—to detect abnormal human activities in real-time surveillance feeds.

The system integrates a **PyQt-based Desktop GUI** and a **Flask Web Interface**, allowing easy monitoring and rapid alerting.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The detection pipeline combines:

* **CNN Backbone:** Extracts spatial features from video frames
* **RNN Layer (LSTM/GRU):** Captures temporal relationships and movement patterns
* **Vision Transformer:** Enhances contextual understanding for complex scenarios
* **Softmax Classifier:** Outputs probability scores for normal/abnormal activities

## 📹 Supported Activities

The current system is trained to detect:

✅ Burglary
✅ Assault / Abuse
✅ Theft
✅ Arrest situations
✅ Drowsiness or Inactivity

You can extend the model by adding new activity classes and retraining.

## 🛠️ Training the Model

Prepare the dataset in the following structure:

```
dataset/
├── normal/
│   ├── video1.mp4
│   └── video2.mp4
├── burglary/
├── abuse/
├── theft/
...
```

Then run:

```bash
python train.py
```

Training hyperparameters can be configured inside `train.py`.
